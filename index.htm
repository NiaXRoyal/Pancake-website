        <h2>How To Make Bananna Pancakes</h2>
        <p>To make pancakes you first need to get all of your dry ingredients (greek yoghurt,flour,sugar and baking powder).</p>
        <p>After that put your wet ingredients together (egg,vanilla extract).</p>
        <p>Mix both your wet and dry ingredients together.</p>
        <p>Once you've done that add your milk (if neccesary)after you have mixed your wet and dry ingredients together</p>
        <p>Once theyre all mixed it should look like cake batter(keep in mind the that it <strong>DOES NOT</strong>taste like cake batter (like at all) so dont try to lick the bowl or what not after your done</p>
        <p>Let your batter rest for a while before the next step;put a tea towl over it to give the baking powder time to rise</p>
        <p>Once thats nicley prepped chop two of your banannas into little squares and put mix into mixture after that proceed to crush the bannanas and mix simultaniously</p>
        <p>After that get your next two bannanas and slice them normally and mix into mixture</p>
        <p>Now that your batter is ready prep your pan;heat it up and spray with a little oil (so that the pancake dosnt stick)before making your pancake </p>
        <p>On each side of the pancake bake for about 3-4mins (but do check from time to time)<p/>
        <Once your pancakes have finished add your prefered topping and an easy amount of whipped cream</p>
